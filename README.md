EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in understanding and preparing the data for analysis. During EDA, we delve into the dataset’s various aspects to uncover insights and patterns that can guide our analysis. This step helps us identify missing values, outliers, trends, correlations, and potential variables of interest. By visualizing the data, we gain an initial understanding of its distribution, central tendencies, and any inherent structure. EDA also aids in formulating hypotheses for further analysis.

In our analysis of Adidas sales data, we conducted EDA to:

1) Understand the dataset’s structure, dimensions, and basic information.
2) Identify duplicate values that might skew our analysis.
3) Visualize the sales trends across years and months.
4) Examine the distribution of sales on a monthly basis and a lot more.
5) This process provides a strong foundation for making data-driven decisions and deriving meaningful insights from the dataset.
